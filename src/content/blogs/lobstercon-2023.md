# Get Ready Bean Town!
As a proud member of the Duress Crew, I can hardly contain my excitement for the upcoming LobsterCon event in Boston this June. This will be my first time
attending a major Premodern event, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the competition has in store.

My fellow Duress Crew members and I have been practicing and tweaking our decks for weeks, trying to find the perfect balance between power and consistency.
We're confident that our decks will stand up to the competition, but we know that we'll be facing some tough opponents.

LobsterCon promises to be a great event, with players from all over the region coming together to celebrate the Golden Age of Magic. I can't wait to meet other
like-minded players who share my love for the game's early days, and to see some of the most iconic cards and strategies in action.

Of course, it's not just about the competition for me. I'm also looking forward to experiencing the unique vibe of a Premodern event. There's something special
about being surrounded by players who all have a deep appreciation for the game's history and mechanics. I'm sure there will be plenty of friendly banter and
good-natured trash talking, but at the end of the day, we're all here because we love Magic.

As for LobsterCon itself, I've heard great things about the venue and the organizers. They've put a lot of effort into making sure that everything runs
smoothly, and I'm sure that it will be a well-organized and fun event. And of course, there's the promise of some amazing seafood in Boston, which is just icing
on the cake.

Overall, I'm counting down the days until LobsterCon. I can't wait to see what the competition has in store, and to soak up the unique atmosphere of a Premodern
event. The Duress Crew is ready to make a name for ourselves, and we're looking forward to representing our community with pride.
