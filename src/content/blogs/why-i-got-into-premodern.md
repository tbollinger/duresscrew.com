# 28 years of MTG

I've been playing magic for a long time. I started playing in 1995, when I was 10 years old. I remember my first pack of cards, and the weird old guy who owned
the card shop in town. It was really cool looking at all the new cards and trying to figure out how to play the game. I remember the first time I played a game
against my brother, we didn't know that "sacrifice" meant your own stuff. So we'd cast turn 1 Sol Ring, into Sol Ring into Sol Ring, and then we'd just sit
there until we drew either a Craw Wurm or an Atog. If you got the Atog, you could sacrifice all of your opponents artifacts. lol. Good times.

# Premodern Magic

What I love most about Premodern is that it's a format that values skill and creativity over just raw power. The power creep wasn't as existent or obvious.
You have to really think about the interactions between cards, and know the history of the game to build effective decks and compete well.
It makes each game feel like a puzzle to be solved. There's so many broken cards in the format, but you have to know how to use them in the right way.

Since the card pool is limited to a specific time period, there are a lot of viable decks. There's a lot of different archetypes and competition being so
diverse really makes it fun again.
From classic Goblins to Psychatog and Landstill. Have a full english breakfast? Better board in those Tormod's Crypts!
The fact that you're playing with some of the most iconic cards makes it more exciting. It's really the format I grew up with, and it's been a blast to play
again.

I think I appreciate most about Premodern is the nostalgia factor. And it's not just about the cards themselves, but also the experience of playing Magic back
in the day. There's a sense of community and camaraderie that I feel like is unique to the Premodern scene, and it's been really cool to be a part of that. In
fact, that's how I met the Duress Crew!

I'm pumped that I stumbled upon the Premodern format. It's been a refreshing change of pace, and really reignited my love for the game. 
I'm excited to see where it goes.
